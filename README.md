# Heisenberg-spin-hamiltonian (under construction)
This script obtains the energies and eigenvalues in a two-spin system from a Heisenberg model, offering the combined base that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian to visualize the components of each spin state as a function of the echange coupling J and the magnetic anisotropy D. This script can handle S=1/2,1,3/2 and 2 spin systems with out of plane magnetic anisotropy D and magnetic field in the z direction B. 
This is part of a deeper study of two spin systems carried out to understand how the nickelocene molecule couples with another spins in STM (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-024-01453-9). A more complete script to fit this kind of interactions that also include the cotunneling formalism to account for the current effectsa in STM is available here: https://github.com/ManishMitharwall/Nickelocene_Spin_Sensor
