# Heisenberg-spin-hamiltonian
This script obtains the energies and eigenvalues in a two-spin system from a Heisenberg model, offering the combined base that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian to visualize the components of each spin state. This script can handle S=1/2,1,3/2 and 2 spin systems with out of plane magnetic anisotropy D and magnetic field in the z direction B.
